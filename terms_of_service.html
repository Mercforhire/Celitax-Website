                        </br></br>
                        <p>These CeliTax terms of service (the "Agreement" or the "Terms") are a legal agreement
                        between you ("you," "your") and Crave N Save Inc., a Canadian corporation ("Crave N 
                        Save," "we", "our" or "us").
                        </br></br>
                        CeliTax provides a simplified tax tool via mobile applications (the "Services") to you 
                        subject to these Terms. Please read these Terms carefully before using the Services. By 
                        accessing or using the Services, you explicitly agree to comply with and be bound by the 
                        Terms and all terms, policies and guidelines incorporated by reference herein. If you do 
                        not agree to all provisions of these Terms, do not use the Services. The Services are for
                        your own use only. You may not resell, lease or provide them in any other way to anyone 
                        else. You must be the age of majority in your jurisdiction to use our Services.
                        These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you 
                        may have with CeliTax or its affiliates for products, services or otherwise. Also, these 
                        Terms are in addition to the end user license agreement for any website or mobile application 
                        we provide.
                        </br></br>
                        CeliTax reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms and conditions contained 
                        in these Terms, or any policy or guideline relating to the Services, at any time and in 
                        its sole discretion, including terminating any mobile application updates to maintain 
                        the services. If we do so, we will notify you at the email address you provide in your 
                        Registration Data (as defined below) or we will post a notice visible to you when you use 
                        our websites or mobile applications. If you do not agree with the changes, you can cancel 
                        your account with us without further obligation. Unless otherwise specified, any changes 
                        or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting of the revisions through the 
                        Services, and your continued use of the Services after such time will constitute your 
                        acceptance of such changes or modifications. You should from time to time review the 
                        Terms and any policies and documents incorporated in them to understand the terms and 
                        conditions that apply to your use of the Services. The Terms will always show the 'last 
                        updated' date at the top. If you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must stop using 
                        the Services. If you have any questions about the Terms, please submit a support request.

                        <b>1. Privacy Policy</b>
                        </br></br>
                        Please refer to CeliTax's privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") for information on how 
                        CeliTax collects, uses and discloses personally identifiable information from its members. 
                        By agreeing to these Terms or using the Services, you agree to our collection, use and 
                        disclosure of your personally identifiable information in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
                        The Privacy Policy can be found here: www.celitax.ca/privacy.
                        </br></br>
                        <b>2. Mobile Services</b>
                        </br></br>
                        CeliTax offers mobile applications as a fast and easy way for our members to use the Services. 
                        If you download and access the Services through the CeliTax apps, your wireless service 
                        carrier's standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, 
                        installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, 
                        and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices. By using the Mobile Services, 
                        you agree that we may communicate with you regarding the Service by text message or other 
                        electronic means to your mobile device, in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Also note that 
                        CeliTax is a paid mobile application. However, we do not ever receive or record any of your 
                        payment information. We do not process transactions – that is all done through the Apple ‘App Store’. 
                        </br></br>
                        <b>3. Ownership and Copyright</b>

                        CeliTax logo and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information, data, software, sound 
                        files, other files, and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, the "Content") 
                        are the property of CeliTax or its licensors and are protected by Canadian and international 
                        copyright laws. All rights to the Content are expressly reserved. Nothing contained in the

                        right to use any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right of CeliTax or any 
                        third party without the prior written permission of CeliTax or such other party that may own
                        such patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right(s).
                        </br></br>
                        <b>4. Trademarks</b>
                        </br></br>
                        CeliTax, its logo and all other product or service names or slogans displayed on or communicated 
                        through the Services are registered and/or common law trademarks of CeliTax and/or its suppliers

                        written permission of CeliTax or the applicable trademark holder. In addition, the look and feel
                        of the Services, including all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts, is the 
                        service mark, trademark and/or trade dress of CeliTax and may not be copied, imitated or used, 
                        in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of CeliTax. All other trademarks, 
                        registered trademarks, product names and company names or logos displayed on or communicated 
                        through the Services are the property of their respective owners. Reference to any products, 
                        services, processes or other information, by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier or 
                        otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation thereof by 
                        CeliTax.
                        </br></br>
                        <b>5. Limited License to the Content</b>
                        </br></br>
                        CeliTax grants you a limited license that can not be sub-licensed to access and use the Services 
                        and to view, copy and print portions of the Content. Such license is subject to these Terms, and
                        specifically conditioned upon the following: (i) you may only view, copy and print portions of 
                        the Content for your own informational, personal and non-commercial use in accordance with the 
                        Terms; (ii) you may not modify or otherwise make derivative uses of the Services or the Content,
                        or any portion thereof; (iii) you may not remove or modify any copyright, trademark, or other 
                        proprietary notices that have been placed in the Content; (iv) you may not use any data mining, 
                        robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods; (v) you may not use the Services or the 
                        Content other than for their intended purpose; and (vi) you may not reproduce, prepare 
                        derivative works from, distribute or display the Services or any Content (except for page 
                        caching), except as provided herein. Except as expressly permitted above, any use of any 
                        portion of the Services or Content without the prior written permission of CeliTax is strictly
                        prohibited and will terminate the license granted herein. This license is revocable at any 
                        time, and for any reason, or for no reason.
                        Any such unauthorized use may also violate applicable laws, including without limitation 
                        copyright and trademark laws. Unless explicitly stated herein, nothing in these Terms may 
                        be construed as conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, 
                        implication or otherwise.
                        You represent and warrant that your use of the Services and the Content will be consistent 
                        with this license and will not infringe or violate the rights of any other party or breach 
                        any contract or legal duty to any other parties, or violate any applicable law. You expressly 
                        agree to indemnify CeliTax against any liability to any person arising out of your use of 
                        Content not in accordance with these Terms.
                        To request permission for uses of Content not included in the foregoing license, you may 
                        contact CeliTax at the address set out at the bottom of these Terms.

                        <b>6. Hyperlinks</b>
                        </br></br>
                        The Services may contain links to third-party Web sites ("Third-Party Sites") and third-party 
                        content ("Third-Party Content") as a service to those interested in this information. You use 
                        links to Third-Party Sites, and any Third-Party Content therein, at your own risk. CeliTax 
                        does not monitor or have any control over, and makes no claim or representation regarding, 
                        Third-Party Content or Third-Party Sites. CeliTax provides these links only as a convenience,
                        and a link to a Third-Party Site or Third-Party Content does not imply CeliTax's endorsement, 
                        adoption or sponsorship of, or affiliation with, such Third-Party Site or Third-Party Content.
                        CeliTax accepts no responsibility for reviewing changes or updates to, or the quality, 
                        content, policies, nature or reliability of, Third-Party Content, Third-Party Sites, or 
                        Web sites linking to the Services. When you leave the Services, our terms and policies 
                        no longer govern. You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and 
                        data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Site, and should make whatever investigation 
                        you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.
                        </br></br>
                        <b>7. Advertisements and Promotions</b>

                        than CeliTax, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such 
                        dealings, are solely between you and such third party. CeliTax is not responsible or liable 
                        for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the 
                        result of the presence of third-party advertisers on the Services.
                        </br></br>

                        prompted by any registration forms on the Services ("Registration Data"); (b) maintain

                        any other information you provide to CeliTax. We mail checks to the address and send 
                        otices to the email address you maintain in your Registration Data. We are not responsible 
                        for any loss you suffer as a result of not keeping your Registration Data current.

                        The Services (excluding Third-Party Sites) are controlled by CeliTax and operated by it from its offices in Burlington, Ontario. While CeliTax has made no effort to publish the Services other than in certain Provinces of Canada and the United States, the Site is accessible elsewhere.

Therefore, you and CeliTax explicitly agree that all disputes, claims or other matters arising from or relating to your use of the Services will be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.
                        You agree that all Claims will be heard and resolved in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Burlington, Ontario. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts over you, stipulate to the fairness and convenience of proceeding in such courts, and covenant not to assert any objection to proceeding in such courts.
                        If you choose to access the Services from locations other than Ontario, you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of such other jurisdiction and you agree to indemnify CeliTax for your failure to comply with any such laws.
