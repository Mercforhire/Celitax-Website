                        At Celitax, we take your privacy seriously. CeliTax works when you upload photos of your 
                        receipts. We understand that information on your receipts can sometimes be sensitive. 
                        Thus, we want to ensure you are absolutely comfortable with what information is collected 
                        when you participate with CeliTax and are knowledgeable as to how this information is used.
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <u>1. What personal data does CeliTax collect?</u>
                        </br></br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Personal Data you provide. We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide 
                            such information. This includes when you register for CeliTax (for example, name, country and 
                            email address), use certain Services, upload receipts, or connect your CeliTax account to online
                            third party services such as Facebook, Twitter or other social networks. The information we 
                            receive from your social networks, is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network.
                            You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites 
                            and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service.</br></br></li>
                            <li>Receipt Data. When you upload receipts to CeliTax, we do not collect information contained 
                            on the receipts, we simply store them for your convenience (collectively, "Receipt Data").</li>
                        </ul>
                        </br>
                        <u>2. How does CeliTax use my Personal Data?</u>
                        </br></br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CeliTax uses any Personal Data you supply to deliver the service you expected when you 
                            gave us the Personal Data. For example, we use this information to display on the mobile 
                            application. When you provide your name and email address when you log in, we use this 
                            information to identify your account so you can use our service. By agreeing to use CeliTax, 
                            you are agreeing to allow us to use your Personal Data to help us improve CeliTax and to 
                            contact you regarding the Services. However, you are free to opt-out from allowing us to 
                            do so. See "Your Choices Regarding Your Information" below to learn how to opt-out of any 
                            further messages of this nature from us.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </br>
                        <u>3. How does CeliTax share my Personal Data?</u>
                        </br></br>
                        CeliTax considers your Personal Data an essential part of our relationship with you and a 
                        key component in delivering you a great service. We do not sell this information or provide 
                        it to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. There are times though when 
                        we need to share this data with certain third parties in order to operate our business. These 
                        circumstances are described below:
                        </br></br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Business transactions and related companies: As we operate CeliTax we may buy or sell 
                            business assets or the company, merge with other companies, reorganize or dissolve. Personal 
                            Data may be part of the transferred assets during any of these events. Consistent with this 
                            Privacy Policy, we may also share your Personal Data with our affiliates.</br></br></li>
                                
                            <li>Anonymized Aggregated Data: As described above, we aggregate and anonymize data and use 
                            and disclose such information for a variety of purposes. However, in these situations, we do
                            not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.</br></br></li>
                            
                            <li>Receipt Data: From time to time, using encryption technology, we may compare our member 
                            database with our clients' or partner' databases to discover overlap between their registered 
                            customers and our registered members. When we find overlap - i.e. that our members are also 
                            their registered customers ("Matched Members") - we may share with those clients or partners 
                            Receipt Data relating to those Matched Members. We do not provide those clients or partners 
                            with your name, address, email address, or any other contact information, but our clients or 
                            partners may already have this information about you in their databases. Our clients or 
                            partners may use any Receipt Data we share as permitted under their own privacy policies, 
                            including to contact you and/or to send you targeted advertising or promotional materials. 
                            We urge you to review the privacy policies of every company you register your personal 
                            information with. If you do not want your Receipt Data shared with our clients or partners 
                            for these purposes, please contact us at Justin.gravelle@celitax.com.</br></br></li>
                            
                            <li>Law and Harm; Jurisdictions: We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe 
                            that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to 
                            protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues or a 
                            breach of our Terms of Use; or to protect our or any other person's rights or property. 
                            However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or 
                            objections that you may have to a third party's, including a government's, request 
                            to disclose your information. Finally, please note that in some cases, personal 
                            information that we collect may be stored or processed outside of Canada. In such 
                            cases, we continue to protect the information with appropriate safeguards, but it 
                            may be subject to the legal jurisdiction of those countries and governmental 
                            authorities in those countries.</li>

                        </br></br>
                        <b>Marketing Communications:</b> If you do not wish to receive promotional emails, you can click the 
                        "unsubscribe" button on promotional email communications. Note that you are not permitted to 
                        unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account 
                        verification, payment confirmations, change or updates to features of the websites or mobile 
                        applications, or technical and security notices.
                        </br></br>
                        <b>Online Advertising:</b> We may permit third party online advertising networks to collect 
                        information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads that 
                        may be relevant to your interests on our websites or mobile applications as well as on other 
                        websites or mobile applications. Typically, the information we share is provided through cookies 
                        or similar tracking technologies. The only way to completely "opt out" of the collection of any 
                        information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on 
                        your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser's or mobile device's technical 
                        information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording 
                        tools. (To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies, you may 
                        wish to visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org and/or the Network Advertising Initiative's online 
                        resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org). Depending on your mobile device, you may not 
                        be able to control tracking technologies through settings.
                        </br></br>
                        <b>Data Retention:</b> We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as 
                        needed to provide you services. Following termination or deactivation of your account, we may 
                        retain information (including Receipt Data) for a commercially reasonable time for backup, 
                        archival, and/or audit purposes. We may retain your information in aggregate or anonymized 
                        form indefinitely. Please submit a support request if you wish to delete your account.
                        </br></br>
                        <u>5. What is not included in this Privacy Policy?</u>
                        </br></br>
                        This Privacy Policy does not apply to any unsolicited information that you provide. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Service and any unsolicited submissions. CeliTax assumes that all unsolicited information is non-confidential and that we are free to reproduce, disclose and distribute it without limitation or attribution.
                        The CeliTax mobile applications and our websites may contain links to third party sites not controlled or operated by CeliTax (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Third Party Sites.
                        </br></br>
                        <u>6. Is my Personal Data secure?</u>
                        </br></br>
                        We take the security of your Personal Data and other information very seriously. We take 
                        reasonable steps to protect this data from loss, unauthorized access or misuse. We only 
                        use trusted servers from a major corporation that does NOT allow public access. 
                        In addition, should you feel that you no longer want to use the Service, you can deactivate 
                        your account within the app (settings) which PERMANENTLY deletes ALL of your Personal and 
                        Receipt Data from our servers. 
                        </br></br>
                        <u>7. What if CeliTax needs to update this policy?</u>
                        </br></br>
                        We reserve the right to modify this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this 
                        Policy, we will change the "Last Revision" date below and will post the updated Policy on 
                        this page.
